1. Go to your `Pictures` folder and create a new folder called `Screenshots`
2. Click `Start` / `Windows`, search for and open `regedit` (also known as Registry Editor)
3. Copy and paste the snippet below into the search bar of the registry editor and press enter:

   ```
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
   ```
4. Now search for the following on the right (should be somewhere near the top of the list) and double click on it:

   ```
   {B7BEDE81-DF94-4682-A7D8-57A52620B86F}
   ```
