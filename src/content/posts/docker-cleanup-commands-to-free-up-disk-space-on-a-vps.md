Docker can quietly consume gigabytes of storage over time. When my VPS starts running low on disk space, I use these two commands…

The first command removes unused Docker build cache:

```
docker builder prune -a -f
```

The second removes unused images, stopped containers, networks, and other Docker resources:

```
docker system prune -a -f
```

Importantly, these commands do not remove Docker volumes, so project data and databases remain safe.

To see how much space Docker is using before and after cleanup:

```
docker system df
```

I run this cleanup periodically on my VPS to keep storage usage under control.
