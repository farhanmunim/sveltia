To automatically return the current year in the format YYYY for your copyright text in Bricks, you can do the following:

- Create a Footer template (wp-admin > Bricks > Templates) and ensure the condition is set to apply to the entire website (template builder > Settings > Template settings > Conditions > Entire website)
- Dropped in a code element in the panel and paste in the below snippet (update as per your requirement!) and then execute the code

This will output a clean p tag with your desired text followed by the current year.

```
<p>
    <?php
    $current_year = date('Y');
    echo '© Farhan Munim ' . $current_year;
    ?>
</p>
```
