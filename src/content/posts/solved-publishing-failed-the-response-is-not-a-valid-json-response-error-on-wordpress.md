1. Either go to your web files via FTP or the file manager of your hosting’s Site Tools/cPanel
2. Go to the root of your WordPress installation, somewhere like `server/public_html/`
3. Now locate the `.htaccess` file (this may be hidden if you are looking at it from your browser, you need to toggle your visibility settings) and simply delete the file (I promise it’s okay!)
4. Now go to `WordPress site/wp-admin > Settings > Permalinks > *select your desired setting if required* > Save Changes` – do this twice
5. A new `.htaccess` will automatically be created – you can go back to your WordPress files and check

You should now be able to create pages with no issues!
