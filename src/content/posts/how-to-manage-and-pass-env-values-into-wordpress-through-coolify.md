## Steps

1. Go to your **project**
2. Open your **environment** (e.g. `production`)
3. Click your **WordPress service**
4. On the left sidebar → click **Environment Variables**
5. Switch to **Developer view** (important)
6. Add your keys and then the `WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA` so it should look like this:

```
KEY_1=XXX
KEY_2=XXX
WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA=define('KEY_1', getenv('KEY_1')); define('KEY_2', getenv('KEY_2'));
```

Then save the environement variables and deploy (or restart).

## Notes (so you don’t get caught again)

- Use **Developer view**, not Normal view
- Keep everything **single-line** (i.e. don’t select Is Multiline?)
- Don’t select Is Literal?
- Don’t wrap anything in quotes
- `WORDPRESS_CONFIG_EXTRA` injects directly into `wp-config.php`
