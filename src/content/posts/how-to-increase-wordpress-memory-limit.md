1. Open your WordPress files via the file manager inside of your hosting or FTP.
2. Locate the `wp-config.php` file which should be in the root (very top) of your website hierarchy and open to edit
3. Locate the area which says `/* Add any custom values between this line and the “stop editing” line. */` and paste in the snippet below this post just below this this (adjust the memory size as required) and then save!

```
define( 'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '64M' );
```
