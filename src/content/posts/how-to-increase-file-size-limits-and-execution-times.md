Add the following inside of a custom code snippet or a child theme:

```
@ini_set( 'upload_max_size' , '120M' );
@ini_set( 'post_max_size', '120M');
@ini_set( 'max_execution_time', '300' );
```

1. `@ini_set( 'upload_max_size' , '120M' );`: This line sets the maximum size of an uploaded file. In this case, it’s being set to 120 megabytes (`120M`). This affects the maximum size allowed for individual files uploaded through PHP forms, such as file upload fields in WordPress media uploader or other form submissions.
2. `@ini_set( 'post_max_size', '120M');`: This line sets the maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept. This includes form submissions and file uploads. It’s important to note that `post_max_size` should typically be larger than `upload_max_size` to accommodate the entire form submission, including any uploaded files. In this case, it’s also set to 120 megabytes (`120M`).
3. `@ini_set( 'max_execution_time', '300' );`: This line sets the maximum time in seconds that a script is allowed to run before it is terminated by the server. Here, it’s set to 300 seconds, or 5 minutes. This is useful for ensuring that long-running scripts, such as those performing complex operations or handling large amounts of data, have enough time to complete without being prematurely terminated.
