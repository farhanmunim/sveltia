title: My WordPress setup checklist (clean, fast, and secure every time)

Most issues people run into later come from:

- weak defaults
- too many plugins
- skipping the basics

So instead of fixing things later, I just follow the same checklist every time.

Nothing fancy. Just a solid baseline that keeps things fast, secure, and easy to maintain.

## 🧱 1. Before you even install WordPress

This part matters more than people think.

### Hosting & stack

- Use **LiteSpeed or Nginx** (I avoid Apache where possible)
- PHP: **8.2+**
- Enable:
  - OPcache
  - Brotli or Gzip
  - HTTP/2 or HTTP/3

### Database

- Use **MariaDB** over MySQL

### Domain & SSL

- Set up SSL (Let’s Encrypt is fine)
- Force HTTPS at **server level** (not via plugin)

## ⚙️ 2. Clean install (start tidy)

After installing WordPress:

Delete:

- default post, page, comments
- unused themes (keep one fallback)
- all unused plugins

Start clean – it makes everything easier later.

## 🔧 3. Core settings (don’t skip these)

### General

- Set a proper site title
- Keep tagline intentional (or remove it)
- Set timezone to **London**
- Disable membership unless needed

### Permalinks

Set:

```
/%postname%/
```

### Reading

- Make sure **“Discourage search engines” is OFF** (unless staging)

### Media

- Set all image sizes to 0 (reduces bloat)

### Discussion

Disable:

- comments (if not needed)
- pingbacks & trackbacks

## 📁 4. Clean media structure

### Disable upload folders

Turn off:

> “Organise uploads into month/year folders”

So instead of:

```
/uploads/2026/03/image.webp
```

You get:

```
/uploads/image.webp
```

Much cleaner long-term.

### Naming (simple SEO win)

Use:

```
service-name-location.webp
```

## ⚡ 5. Performance baseline (no overkill)

### Caching

Pick one:

- server-level cache (best)
- OR a lightweight plugin

### Remove what you don’t need

- emoji scripts
- unused block CSS
- unused scripts/styles

### Disable:

- XML-RPC
- oEmbed
- Heartbeat API (limit or disable)

### Database

- limit post revisions (3–5 max)
- set up auto-cleanup (or cron)

## 🧼 6. Code clean-up (big impact, often ignored)

- Remove jQuery (if not needed)
- Load scripts with `defer` or `async`
- Inline critical CSS
- Avoid page builders where possible

This is where sites go from “okay” to actually fast.

## 🔐 7. Security (non-negotiable)

### Basic hardening

- Change login URL
- Limit login attempts
- Force strong passwords

### Lock down files

Disable file editing:

```
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
```

Also:

- protect `wp-config.php`
- block PHP execution in `/uploads`

### Authentication

- Enable 2FA
- Add login alerts (email is fine)

### Firewall

- Add **8G firewall rules**
- Use a **WAF** (Cloudflare or server-level)

## 🧠 8. SEO basics (keep it simple)

- Set clean page titles
- Add meta descriptions
- Create XML sitemap

### Robots.txt

- block junk
- allow important pages

### Structure

- keep URLs clean
- use internal linking early

## 📊 9. Analytics (don’t overcomplicate)

- Add analytics (Google or privacy-first alternative)
- If possible, use server-side tracking

## 🧩 10. Plugin philosophy (this is where most sites fail)

Only install plugins that:

- solve a real problem
- are maintained
- do one job well

Avoid:

- “all-in-one” plugins
- heavy page builders

Less plugins = less problems.

## 🗂️ 11. Backups (seriously, don’t skip this)

- daily automated backups
- stored off-site (not on the same server)
- test restore once

You don’t want to figure this out under pressure.

## 🚀 12. Deployment basics

### Staging

- build on staging first
- block indexing

### Migration

- run search & replace for URLs
- clear all caches after launch

## 🧪 13. Post-launch checks

Test:

- forms
- emails (SMTP set up properly)
- mobile responsiveness

Run:

- Lighthouse / PageSpeed

Check:

- 404s
- redirects

## 🔁 14. Ongoing maintenance

### Weekly

- update plugins + core
- check backups

### Monthly

- clean database
- review performance

### Quarterly

- remove unused plugins
- tidy things up

## 🧠 Bonus (small things that make a big difference)

- Disable REST API for non-logged users (if not needed)
- Preload fonts properly
- Self-host fonts (no external calls)
- Use WebP/AVIF images only
- Limit admin users
- Change database prefix (`wp_` → custom)
- Disable WP cron → use real server cron

## Final thoughts

None of this is complicated.

It’s just a **repeatable baseline** that avoids:

- slow sites
- security issues
- plugin bloat

If you set things up properly from the start, you don’t spend time fixing avoidable problems later.

And honestly – that’s the biggest win.
