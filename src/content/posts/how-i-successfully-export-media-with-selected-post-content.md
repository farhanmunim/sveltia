I rebuild my WordPress site fairly often. I like starting clean, but I always want to keep my posts and media.

This time around, I tried to do things properly and use a plugin to export posts *with* their media instead of relying on manual workarounds.

The posts imported fine.
The media didn’t.

If you’ve run into the same issue – especially when Cloudflare is involved – this is what actually fixed it for me.

## The setup

- Old site hosted behind Cloudflare
- New WordPress install on a different server
- Using the [Export media with selected content (by DKZR) plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/export-media-with-selected-content/)
- Posts import successfully
- Media consistently fails to import

No obvious PHP or WordPress errors. Just missing attachments.

## What *wasn’t* the problem

Before getting anywhere useful, I ruled out the usual suspects:

- PHP memory limits
- Upload and download limits
- Execution timeouts
- Plugin configuration

None of these made any difference. If you’re seeing posts come across but media fail silently, this is a good sign the issue is elsewhere.

## Testing the real failure point

At this point, the important question was simple:

> Can the new server actually download media files from the old site?

To answer that, I built a small [test media URL plugin](https://github.com/farhanmunim/wordpress/blob/main/test-media-urls.zip) on the **destination site** that attempts to fetch a single media URL from the old site and reports the response code.

The result was consistent: **403 Forbidden**.

That ruled out WordPress entirely. The request wasn’t even getting through.

## Cloudflare and automated requests

Looking at the response headers made it clear Cloudflare was blocking the request.

I tried:

- Enabling Development Mode
- Bypassing cache

Neither helped.

What *did* work was **whitelisting the destination server’s IP address in Cloudflare** on the old site.

As soon as I did that:

- The test request returned `200 OK`
- Media files downloaded successfully
- The import completed as expected

## Why this happens

Media import plugins don’t “copy” files directly. They make HTTP requests from the new site to the old one.

From Cloudflare’s perspective, this can look like:

- Automated traffic
- Scraping
- Or a potential abuse pattern

So the requests get blocked…quietly.

Once the server IP is trusted, the imports work normally.

## What to check if your media imports keep failing

If you’re stuck with missing media during a WordPress migration:

- Test media URLs directly from the destination server
- Check HTTP status codes (403 is a big clue)
- Review Cloudflare firewall and security settings
- Temporarily whitelist the destination server IP
- Retry the import

In my case, the plugin itself was doing exactly what it was supposed to do.
