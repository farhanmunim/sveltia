## 1. Connect to Your VPS via SFTP

Use any SFTP client (like FileZilla or your terminal).

You’ll need:

- **Host**: your VPS IP (if you use Tailscale, you need to use the assigned Tailscale address for the VPS)
- **Username**: usually `root` (or your server user)
- **Password or SSH key**
- **Port**: `22` (default)

Once connected, you’ll be browsing your server files like a normal file explorer.

### 2. Navigate to the WordPress Files

Coolify stores service data inside Docker volumes.

The path you’re looking for is:

```
/var/lib/docker/volumes/service_name/_data
```

### 3. Find Your `service_name`

Each app/service in Coolify gets its own volume.

To figure out which one is yours:

- Go to your Coolify dashboard
- Open your project → service
- Check the URL or service name – it’s usually included there

That name will match the folder inside `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.

### 4. What You’ll See

Inside `_data`, you’ll typically find:

- `wp-content`
- `wp-config.php`
- core WordPress files

From here, you can:

- upload themes/plugins
- edit files
- download backups

## That’s it

No magic – just SFTP + knowing where Coolify stores things.
